# Web Scraping Retail Product Data

This project demonstrates how to use Python for web scraping, data analysis, and visualization.  
It simulates a real-world scenario where a data analyst extracts product data from an e-commerce website to support pricing strategy and competitor analysis.

## Objectives
- Scrape product details such as names, prices, and ratings from a target website.
- Clean and organize the data using pandas.
- Visualize key insights such as average prices and most common ratings.
- Provide actionable insights based on the extracted data.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Requests
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Key Highlights
- Real-world web scraping project using industry-standard libraries.
- Data cleaning, transformation, and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualization of product trends to support data-driven decisions.

## Project Structure
- `jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the code, analysis, and visualizations.
  
## Future Improvements
- Expand to more websites and compare pricing trends.
- Automate the scraping process and schedule regular data pulls.
- Integrate sentiment analysis on product reviews.
